# OpenPAYGO Documentation Website

The OpenPAYGO is an open source token system to enable PAYGO functionality in new products. This repository holds [the documentation for OpenPAYGO](https://enaccess.github.io/OpenPAYGO-docs/), and it is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Pre-requisites
